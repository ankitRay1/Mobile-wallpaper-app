Change App icon
---------------

### Place your app icon inside mipmap folder -\> app\\src\\main\\res\\mipmap\\

Icon name should be “**ic\_launcher.png**”

Change application package name
-------------------------------

### In Android Studio, you can do this:

-   

For example, if you want to change `com.example.app` to
`my.awesome.game`, then:

1.  In your ***Project pane***, click on the little gear icon ( ![Gears
    icon](https://i.stack.imgur.com/lkezT.png) )

2.  Uncheck / De-select the `Compact Empty Middle Packages` option

![enter image description here](https://i.imgur.com/Q4pqOsU.png)

3.  Your package directory will now be broken up in individual
    directories

4.  Individually select each directory you want to rename, and:

    -   Right-click it
    -   Select `Refactor`
    -   Click on `Rename`
    -   In the Pop-up dialog, click on `Rename Package` instead of
        Rename Directory
    -   Enter the new name and hit **Refactor**
    -   Click **Do Refactor** in the bottom
    -   Allow a minute to let Android Studio update all changes
    -   *Note: When renaming `com` in Android Studio, it might give a
        warning. In such case, select***Rename All**

    ![Enter image description here](https://i.imgur.com/L8ImgDW.png)

5.  Now open your ***Gradle Build File*** (`build.gradle` - Usually
    `app` or `mobile`). Update the `applicationId` in the
    `defaultConfig` to your new Package Name and Sync Gradle, if it
    hasn’t already been updated automatically:

    ![Refactor Directories](https://imgur.com/H42rrsD.png)

6.  You may need to change the `package=` attribute in your manifest.

7.  Clean and Rebuild.

8.  ***Done!*** Anyway, Android Studio needs to make this process a
    little simpler.
